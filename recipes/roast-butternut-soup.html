    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Roast butternut is 1000 times greater than butternut cooked any other way!
    </p>
    <p>It gets even more incredible when turned into a creamy soup!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large butternut squash</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped shallot</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon maple syrup</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>3 to 4 cups (24 to 32 ounces) vegetable broth</li>
      <li>1 to 2 tablespoons butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and line a rimmed baking
        sheet with parchment paper. Place the butternut squash on the pan and
        drizzle each half with just enough olive oil to lightly coat the squash
        on the inside (about ½ teaspoon each). Rub the oil over the inside of
        the squash and sprinkle it with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the squash face down and roast until it is tender and completely
        cooked through, about 40 to 50 minutes (don’t worry if the skin or flesh
        browns—that’s good for flavor). Set the squash aside until it’s cool
        enough to handle, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a large soup pot, warm 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium
        heat until shimmering (if your blender has a soup preset, use a medium
        skillet to minimize dishes.) Add the chopped shallot and 1 teaspoon
        salt. Cook, stirring often, until the shallot has softened and is
        starting to turn golden on the edges, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the
        garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute, stirring frequently.
        Transfer the contents to your stand blender (see notes on how to use an
        immersion blender instead).
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a large spoon to scoop the butternut squash flesh into your blender.
        Discard the tough skin. Add the maple syrup, nutmeg and a few twists of
        freshly ground black pepper to the blender. Pour in 3 cups vegetable
        broth, being careful not to fill the container past the maximum fill
        line (you can work in batches if necessary, and stir in any remaining
        broth later).
      </li>
      <li>
        Securely fasten the lid. Blend on high (or select the soup preset, if
        available), being careful to avoid hot steam escaping from the lid. Stop
        once your soup is ultra creamy and warmed through.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you would like to thin out your soup a bit more, stir in the
        remaining cup of broth. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons butter or olive oil, to
        taste, and blend well. Taste and stir in more salt and pepper, if
        necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your soup is piping hot from the blending process, you can pour it
        into serving bowls. If not, pour it back into your soup pot and warm the
        soup over medium heat, stirring often, until it’s nice and steamy. I
        like to top individual bowls with some extra black pepper.

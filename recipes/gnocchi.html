    <p>

    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound starchy potatoes</li>
      <li>8 ounces fresh spinach</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour, plus more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Bake potatoes until tender, about an hour.
        Immediately split them open to let the steam escape. When you can handle
        the potatoes, scoop out their flesh.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the potatoes bake, roughly chop the spinach. Put the oil in a
        small skillet or saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the spinach, season
        to taste, and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and wilted, about
        5 minutes. Rinse under cold water and squeeze dry. Transfer to a food
        processor and purée until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it. Pass potato flesh
        through a ricer or food mill, stir in the spinach purée, and season to
        taste. Sprinkle 1/4 cup flour on a clean counter or cutting board, and
        knead the potatoes with it, sprinkling in the remaining 1/2 cup flour,
        until the dough just comes together. Pinch off a piece of the dough, and
        boil it to make sure it will hold its shape. If it does not, knead in a
        bit more flour (no more than necessary), and try again; the gnocchi will
        float to the top and look a little raggedy when ready.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll a piece of the dough into a rope about 1/2-inch thick, then cut the
        rope into 1/2-inch lengths. Score each piece by rolling it along the
        tines of a fork; as each piece is ready, put it on a baking sheet lined
        with parchment or wax paper; do not allow the gnocchi to touch one
        another.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the gnocchi to the boiling water a few at a time, and gently stir;
        adjust the heat so the mixture doesn’t boil too vigorously. A few
        seconds after they rise to the surface, the gnocchi are done; remove
        them with a slotted spoon or mesh strainer, and finish with any of the
        following sauces:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Tomato Sauce</strong>: Cook a small chopped onion in olive oil
          until soft. Add minced garlic, 3 to 4 cups of chopped tomatoes, canned
          or fresh, and salt and pepper. Cook at a steady bubble until
          ‘‘saucy.’’ If the sauce becomes too thick, add a splash of the gnocchi
          cooking water before serving. Garnish with torn basil and/or grated
          Parmesan.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Brown Butter, Sage, and Parmesan
            <i>(highly recommended)</i></strong
          >: Put 4 tablespoons butter and a handful of fresh sage leaves (40
          wouldn’t be too many) in a skillet over medium heat. Cook until the
          butter is light brown and the sage is sizzling, about 3 minutes. Toss
          with the gnocchi, some of their cooking water and loads of grated
          Parmesan.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Olive Oil and Garlic</strong>: Put at least a tablespoon of
          minced garlic in a puddle of olive oil, along with (optional)
          red-pepper flakes and/or chopped anchovies. Cook until the garlic just
          turns golden (but no more than that). Toss with the gnocchi, some of
          their cooking water and plenty of chopped parsley.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bacon and Cream</strong>: Cook some chopped bacon, prosciutto
          or pancetta in a bit of olive oil over medium-low heat until nearly
          crisp. Stir in 1/2 cup heavy cream and a lot of pepper. Let the cream
          thicken slightly before adding the gnocchi.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
